                <h2>What are Databases?</h2>
                <h3>A structured set of data</h3>
                <p>Databases are collection of information,they are used for creating;
                  manuplating ,and deleting data.There are many different types of
                  databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of rational
                  database or non-rational basedase.Relationships means a set of of our
                  data is related to another section of our data.Meanwhile in non-relational
                  database there is not a common related section of  our data.Our data bases are
                  put into sections of data called schema,inside each schema each data set in
                  organized into tables,those tables contain contain column and rows to house
                   that particular set of data.

                <img src="databaseimg/harddrive.jpg" class="img" alt="">
                <p>All databasesare just a bin of storage.<br/>This storage is housed in your
                    <br/>harddrive;often times large companies will have floors upon floors of
                    just <br/>database storage(think of NSA styled).Our computer stores on the
                    harddrive,we are about to create new information ,read information,update
                    information and delete information.

                <h3>Searching </h3>
                <img src="databaseimg/database-search.jpg"class="img" alt="">
                <p>since there could  potentially be alot of information a databases
                  stores one problem we might run in to finding is finding the data we
                  are looking for.Imagine we had room full of books and you were asked
                  to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book.Well you might start picking up
                  each book,checking the title and moving onto the next until you found it.
                  That id very slow as most libraries discovered.Instead if we were to  ID
                   each item we can find it quickly.

                <h3>Interaction</h3>
                <img src="databaseimg/dbinteraction.png" class="img" alt="">
                <p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage
                    bin that holds onto saved data.Well if only one user had access
                    to that data its just like what we have built in to our own computers
                    ,it wouldn't be useful to other users.However the joy of having a database
                     is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with,creating,reading,updating
                     and deleting information that all users would see.

                <img src="databaseimg/database-companies.jpg" class="img"alt="">
                <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the sorting
                    of information.As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount
                    of companies on the market.That being said alot of their software is
                    free for most users,think of MySQL,which while being an incredible DB
                    is completely free of cost and is used by a large company called
                    Facebook.
